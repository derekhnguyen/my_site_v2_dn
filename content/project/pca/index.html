<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Here we explore the a dataset provided by, <em><a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog">Google Earth Engine</a></em>, that provides various environmental and climatic data on countries throughout the world. For this particular project, variables observed are: annual mean temperature, annual mean rainfall, accessibility to cities, tree canopy cover, cloudiness, elevation, and cropland cover.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>world_env &lt;- read_csv(here::here(&quot;csv&quot;, &quot;world_env_vars.csv&quot;))</code></pre>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mean annual rainfall and tree canopy cover is most positively correlated. This correlation makes sense because rainfall provides nutrients for trees and tree canopy cover would grow.</li>
<li>Mean annual rainfall is also positively correlated with cloudiness. This seems valid because cloudy days mean higher potential for rainfall.</li>
<li>Mean annual temperature and cropland cover are inversely correlated.</li>
<li>Mean annual temperature and elevation are inversely correlated. This makes sense because as elevation increases, temperature goes down and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
